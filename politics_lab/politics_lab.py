def create_voting_dict():
    """
    Input: None (use voting_data above)
    Output: A dictionary that maps the last name of a senator
            to a list of numbers representing the senator's voting
            record.
    Example: 
        >>> create_voting_dict()['Clinton']

    This procedure should return a dictionary that maps the last name
    of a senator to a list of numbers representing that senator's
    voting record, using the list of strings from the dump file (strlist). You
    will need to use the built-in procedure int() to convert a string
    representation of an integer (e.g. '1') to the actual integer
    (e.g. 1).

    You can use the split() procedure to split each line of the
    strlist into a list; the first element of the list will be the senator's
    name, the second will be his/her party affiliation (R or D), the
    third will be his/her home state, and the remaining elements of
    the list will be that senator's voting record on a collection of bills.
    A "1" represents a 'yea' vote, a "-1" a 'nay', and a "0" an abstention.

    The lists for each senator should preserve the order listed in voting data.
